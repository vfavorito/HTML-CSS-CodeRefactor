# Homework-1 Code Refactor
## Horiseon Webpage 
### For this Homework assignment I recieved source code for Horiseon's webpage.  The code I recieved while functioning was lacking comments, missing some accessibility standards, and had excess code that could be condensed.

### After refactoring the source code given to me, readability and accessibility has been improved while keeping the original code's functionality. ![Image of clean code](assets/images/postrefactorcode.PNG)
