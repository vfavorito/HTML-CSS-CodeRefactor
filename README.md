# Homework-1 Code Refactor

## Horiseon Webpage 

### Overview:
 In this repository I received source code for Horiseon's webpage.  The code I recieved had no comments, lacked on accessibility standards, and had excess code that could be condensed.  I took the original source code and refactored it.

The process involved:
* Replacing div tags with semantic HTML elements
* Adding alt attributes to images
* Combining classes that had identical style properties in CSS
* Adding comments throughout the HTML and CSS code
 
Even though the code functioned properly,  it needed to be cleaned up. After refactoring the source code given to me, readability and accessibility has been improved while keeping the original code's functionality.
